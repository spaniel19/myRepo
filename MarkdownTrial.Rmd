## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Built with R version `r getRversion()`.

```{r} 
?image
```

```{r message = FALSE} 
?image
```

```{r message = FALSE, echo=FALSE} 
?image
```

I like `r params$d`.

## Why I like dogs
* I like dogs because they are:
  + a bit stupid
  + always happy
  + always enthusiastic
  + cute
  
## Cats
I do, *however*, also like cats.

````{r echo=FALSE, warning= FALSE, results = 'asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(mtcars[1:5,], caption = "A knitr kable.")
```

## Markdown
You can use R Markdown's markdown to make

- Latex equations, $E = mc^2$
- And bibliographies, provided you indicate the correct .bib file to be integrated
